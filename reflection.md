# My Personal Event Reflection

## Activity Description
### What were the expectations and what did you do?

The Crimson Code Hackathon is a 24-hour sprint-like event where computer programmers collaborate in teams to develop an application, game, extension, or program of some sort. After the 24 hours are up, teams present their projects to judges to compete for prizes. I participated exactly as intended, working with a team to develop an application that tries to **"Reinvent the Wheel"**, which was the theme of this years hackathon. In my teams case, this was a web-application trying to streamline the searching and understanding of government regulations to a non-expert reader. So, *reinventing the wheel* of government document readability and accessibility, while also modernizing the workflow entirely. 

## Technical Decisions
### What decisions did you take from a technical perspective throughout this activity/event?

Our team quickly decided that we wanted to try and integrate Google Gemini's API into our application to try and be in the running for one of the Major League Hacking specific prizes. This seemed easiest to pull off in a React web-application, so right away we started on learning the API integration methods using javascript. 

## Contributions
### Did you participate alone or with a team?

I was able to go to event already having one teammate, and at the event we were able to find another group of 2. So, we combined forces and started "hacking" with a full team of 4 developers. 

### If with a team, what were your specific individual contributions?

During brainstorming, I was able to provide some good ideas that led to our project selection. Furthermore, I was able to research API integration methods in javascript, utilize LLM's to help prototype ideas, and facilitate team coordination and version control using the GitHub I set up for the hackathon. 

## Quality Assessment
### How would you assess your participation in this event? What would you do differently if you could redo the event?

The main hurdle we had initially was trouble coming up with an idea. Once we got past that however, we were able to begin development and were quickly able to get prototypes and feature functionality implemented for proof of concept. Then we quickly transitioned into refining features and combining them into the resulting application. Overall, we worked well as a team and had a fun time with the events scheduled workshops and side-events. This event allowed us to learn about some new technologies, and a huge takeaway was how easily you can get an AI Chatbot or similar AI integration into your application. <br>
If I were to do the event again, I would simply try to think of more fun and creative ideas to be able to learn new tools, frameworks, and API's. I also think it would be rewarding to use an event like a hackathon to try something totally out of the ordinary for me, such as game development.
